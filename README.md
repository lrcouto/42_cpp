  **June 15th 2022** - I just came back from a 4-month freeze and I'm rushing this project. Trying to kill one module every 2~3 days at most, while having a full time job and trying not to burnout. I kinda hate this project. Just finishing module_01.
  
  **June 16th 2022** - Spent most of my time today studying concepts that I'm gonna need for module_02. Stuff about how exactly floating point numbers work, orthodox canonical classes, operator overloads, etc. There's a pretty cool exercise about verifying if a point is positioned inside a tringle on this list, but I'm not gonna do it because it'd take too much time. Thanks 42SP, I love leaving cool stuff on the table because of your focus on speed over actual learning! Oh well, I've done MiniRT, I've had my share of point coordinates I guess.

  - Adding the Fixed class for module_02/ex00. Due to a joke comparing the orthodox canonical class with the medieval orthodox church, I have added a classic illumination of a knight fighting a snail to my class.

  **June 17th 2022** - Defined the class parameters required for ex01 on module_02. Did one evaluation for module_01, but couldn't get the second yet. Studied a bit more about how computers represent numbers. Will aim to finish tomorrow.

  **June 18th 2022** - Module_02 is pretty heavy on the theory. Had to do a little further research on ad hoc polymorphism to understand the third exercise. All that's left is to implement the fuckton of operator overloads it asks for, and then test everything.

  - Finished it. Brain explosion moment when I realized how post-increments actually work.

  **June 19th 2022** - While waiting for evaluations on module_02, started module_03. Cool, I'm a big Borderlands fan, but this language's verbosity is starting to annoy me. Completed ex00. It's 4am.

  **June 20th 2022** - Turned in module_02 and finished module_03, that I will turn in tomorrow. Inheritance is cursed and that Diamond Problem was concocted by the devil himself. It works well enough now, though.
