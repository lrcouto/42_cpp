  **June 15th 2022** - I just came back from a 4-month freeze and I'm rushing this project. Trying to kill one module every 2~3 days at most, while having a full time job and trying not to burnout. I kinda hate this project. Just finishing module_01.
  
  **June 16th 2022** - Spent most of my time today studying concepts that I'm gonna need for module_02. Stuff about how exactly floating point numbers work, orthodox canonical classes, operator overloads, etc. There's a pretty cool exercise about verifying if a point is positioned inside a tringle on this list, but I'm not gonna do it because it'd take too much time. Thanks 42SP, I love leaving cool stuff on the table because of your focus on speed over actual learning! Oh well, I've done MiniRT, I've had my share of point coordinates I guess.

  - Adding the Fixed class for module_02/ex00. Due to a joke comparing the orthodox canonical class with the medieval orthodox church, I have added a classic illumination of a knight fighting a snail to my class.

  **June 17th 2022** - Defined the class parameters required for ex01 on module_02. Did one evaluation for module_01, but couldn't get the second yet. Studied a bit more about how computers represent numbers. Will aim to finish tomorrow.

  **June 18th 2022** - Module_02 is pretty heavy on the theory. Had to do a little further research on ad hoc polymorphism to understand the third exercise. All that's left is to implement the fuckton of operator overloads it asks for, and then test everything.

  - Finished it. Brain explosion moment when I realized how post-increments actually work.

  **June 19th 2022** - While waiting for evaluations on module_02, started module_03. Cool, I'm a big Borderlands fan, but this language's verbosity is starting to annoy me. Completed ex00. It's 4am.

  **June 20th 2022** - Turned in module_02 and finished module_03, that I will turn in tomorrow. Inheritance is cursed and that Diamond Problem was concocted by the devil himself. It works well enough now, though.

  **June 22th 2022** - Uploaded some of module_04 yesterday but didn't log. I am SO FUCKING TILTED with this module. I can't get anything to work.

  **June 24th 2022** - Finished and turned in module_04, started module_05. I am very tired and can't concentrate, so I couldn't do any significant progress today, which upsets me. I fixed a little mistake on module_03.

  **June 27th 2022** - Uploading ex00 and ex01. This list is indeed bureaucratic. And boring. Lots of grunt work writing the classes and exceptions. Ex02 seems even worse but ex03 seems simpler. We'll see.

  **June 29th 2022** - Ex02-module05 done. Expecting to finish tomorrow.

  **June 30th 2022** - Finished module_05, ready to turn in. This one was a drag. Hoping the last 3 will be a little more interesting.

  **July 05th 2022** - Procrastinated. Bored with the project. Trying to pick up the pace.

  **July 06th 2022** - Bit bored with this. Did some progress. Uploading a version that doesn't compile. 42 São Paulo spent 2 years not giving a single shit about the community building (and sabotaging the community when we tried to build it ourselves) and now both the campus and the discord are dead as fuck. I've been flying solo for a good while. Doesn't feel good, I feel like I have no one to work with me on the projects or to discuss stuff, and it feels pointless to deal with 42SP's idiosyncrasies if I'm not getting the peer to peer learning in return. I'm just working by myself and I guess I will keep doing so in the foreseeable future. This fucking sucks.

  **July 12th 2022** - Cleared up some errors. Not compiling but better than it was before.

  **July 13th 2022** - Program compiling and basic stuff is working. Need to treat some edge cases and floating point stuff, but we're getting somewhere.

  **July 14th 2022** - Finishing ex00. I think it's good enough. I'll start ex01 tomorrow.

  **July 18th 2022** - Finished CPP06 and closed the repo. Did the first exercise of CPP07. I need to finish this week because I'm bleeding out lives, so I can't afford to have another one of those spouts of procrastinations. At least the exercises seem a bit shorter now.
